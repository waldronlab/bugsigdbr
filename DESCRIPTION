Description:
    The bugsigdbr package implements convenient access to bugsigdb.org 
    from within R/Bioconductor. The goal of the package is to facilitate import of 
    BugSigDB data into R/Bioconductor, provide utilities for extracting microbe
    signatures, and enable export of the extracted signatures to plain text files
    in standard file formats such as GMT.
