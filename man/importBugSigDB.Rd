\description{
Obtain published microbial signatures from bugsigdb.org
}
\details{
There are three different options to obtain data from 
BugSigDB, as determined by the \code{version} argument.
\itemize{
\item a Zenodo DOI: use this option if you would like to obtain
one of the stable release versions of BugSigDB on Zenodo. These
stable release versions of BugSigDB have been automatically checked and
manually reviewed and provide for the highest data quality. Select this option
if you would like to incorporate BugSigDB into analysis and published
research. If not specified otherwise, the \code{importBugSigDB} function
will obtain the most recent stable release from Zenodo by default.
\item \code{"devel"}: use this option to obtain the latest version
("bleeding edge") of BugSigDB from the BugSigDBExports GitHub repo 
(see references).
Note that this will also include incomplete and not reviewed content,
which should be filtered out prior to an analysis.
Select this option if you are a curator that actively contributes to
BugSigDB and would like to access data that you and other curators have 
recently contributed to BugSigDB and that has not been included in a stable
release yet. 
\item a git commit hash: it might be occasionally of interest to obtain
a specific snapshot of the BugSigDBExports GitHub repo, e.g. for the sake of 
debugging and troubleshooting. This can be done by providing the short
7-character git commit hash (SHA) or the full SHA of the export of choice.
To provide the full SHA, go to the BugSigDBExports commits page (see references)
and use the copy symbol to the left of the 7-character codes to copy the full
SHA code of the export version you want to use.
